Improvement we made:

1. Incorrect order matching: We fix the problem by ensuring that our matching engine is correctly prioritizing orders based on price and time.

2. Race conditions: We implemented proper synchronization and locking mechanisms to manage access to shared resources. 

3. Unauthorized access: Someone tries to sneak into the system without permission, which can put the whole system's security at risk.

4. System downtime or performance issues: Unexpected system outages or performance degradation that could disrupt trading activities and affect the overall functioning of the stock exchange.

5. Internal system errors: Potential software bugs, hardware failures, or other technical issues within the stock exchange system that could lead to incorrect or incomplete trade processing.

6. Network latency and timeouts: The system may experiences network latency or timeouts when reciving massive requests, causing delays in processing orders or updates.

7. Concurrency: Fixed bugs when multiple users connect to our service simultaneously.
